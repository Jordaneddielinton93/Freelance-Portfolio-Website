            <p>As a Web Developer I spend my whole day , practically everyday learning new Technologies and creating beautiful responsive web application and websites.</p>
            <p>I learnt the Key skills needed to become a front-end developer from school of code bootcamp , we were regulary paired into {`group's`} and were given {"project's"} to learn new skills such as responsivenes, {"Api's"} , HTML/CSS and Javascript frameworks
            </p>
            <p>I then joined the team of school of code as an Assistant Coach to help the next cohorts along , the month prior to joining i began learning backend to get the full stack view of how web-development worked.</p>
            <p>2 Years since i started coding i have now began to use my skills to help out my local community buidling websiteâ€™s for family and friends doing free lance work.</p>
